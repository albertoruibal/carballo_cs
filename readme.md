Carballo Chess Engine in C#
===========================

This is a conversion of the Carballo Chess Engine code from Java to C# using Sharpen. The original project is at:

http://github.com/albertoruibal/carballo

It only implements the UCI interface to be used in chess GUIs like Arena.

The performance of the converted code is slightly slower then the original Java code.

It uses this version of Sharpen:

https://github.com/slluis/sharpen

The sharpen jar and the conversion script (convert.sh) are included in the root of the project.
